Pluviometric analysis of Centa San Nicol√≤ meteorological station data.  
Specifically, to calculate Gumbel's parameters, we used three different ways:

* momentum method;
* least squares method;
* maximum likelihood method.

To find the *best parameters* we applied Pearson's test and we used 
results to plot the called **LSPP**.

These data will be used to design a storm water drainage network (you can find more info about SWDN at the [*OSF* project page](https://osf.io/6zpav/)).
